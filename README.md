# Brain Rewiring Protocol  
Behavioral Optogenetics: A Field Manual for Experiential Neuroplasticity

This little site and the PDF inside it are something I wrote for myself first, then for a handful of friends who asked, “Could you send me what you’re doing?”  
It kept growing because people kept saying, “This actually helps,” which is apparently addictive.

### What it is
A 10–20 minute daily practice that uses attention as the delivery system and emotional salience as the consolidation signal.  
No lasers required. Feeling is the mechanism.

It borrows the best pieces from Rick Hanson, Laurel Mellin, Bruce Ecker, Bruce Perry, Eugene Gendlin, and a dozen neuroscience papers — then strips away the gatekeeping, the price tags, and anything that ever made someone feel like they were failing at healing.

### What it is not
- Medical advice  
- Psychotherapy  
- A cure for anything  
- A replacement for the care from licensed professionals  

It is simply an open-source, research-informed way to play gently with neuroplasticity, emotion, and habit.  
Take whatever resonates. Leave the rest without apology.

### Important — please read this part
If anything in here ever increases your distress, flattens your mood, or triggers a sense of “I’m doing this wrong,” stop immediately. That reaction is valuable data, not evidence that you’re broken.  

It usually means your nervous system needs something different first — co-regulation, somatic support, slower pacing, or simply rest — before self-directed practice is safe or useful.

If you live with complex trauma, chronic illness, dissociation, or anything else that makes your system fragile, treat this material like a curious guest, not a prescription. You are the only expert on what your body can hold today.

### How to use this repo
- The live site[](https://droberts-ca.github.io/brain-rewiring-protocol/) is the full interactive version with a built-in tracker.  
- `brain-rewiring-protocol.pdf` is the printable, no-distraction field manual.  
- Everything is CC-BY 4.0 — share, remix, translate, print, give away. Just keep the safety note attached.

If it helps even one person feel a little less alone in their skin, it has already done its job.

With care (and a quiet breath),
